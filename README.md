Hello guys.

Knowing your limit is something incredible and that's why I started in the world of programming, my curiosity for solving problems took me to a world where I previously thought It was, "installing programs". Today I see myself within them through technologies like JavaScript, React and Nodejs. And now I know that every problem has a solution.
