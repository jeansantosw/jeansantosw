### Hello guys.

With over 8 years of experience in JavaScript development, I am a professional who transforms challenges into scalable solutions. Early in my career, I faced difficulties with software architectures that lacked robustness, and that experience was a turning point.

Today, I apply that lesson to every project, focusing on code quality, security, and scalability. I specialize in React, Next.js, Node.js, and AEM, always aiming to build systems that are not only functional but also solid and long-lasting.
